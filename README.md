# calculator

A project based on the The Odin Project's curriculum: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator

Extra credit sections, expect for the keyboard support, are included so far. I would also like to add functionality for handling negative numbers, but that's a bit complicated (for me), so stay positive, please.
